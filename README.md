# SwipeablePageView Demo App

This sample demo app showcases the usage of the **SwipeablePageView** componentâ€”a flexible container view designed to enable users to quickly switch between different parts of an app. The app demonstrates both horizontal and vertical swipe configurations with dedicated previews.

## Overview

- The **SwipeablePageView Demo App** provides a simple, full-screen paging experience using `SwipeablePageView`, a Swift package that lives in its own GitHub repository:
  [https://github.com/sergendev/SwipeablePageView](https://github.com/sergendev/SwipeablePageView) 
- It illustrates how to integrate the component into your SwiftUI projects to allow smooth transitions between app sections. Previews have been added for both horizontal and vertical swipe directions.

## Requirements

- **Xcode:** 16 or later
- **Swift:** 6.0 or later
- **iOS:** 18.0 and up (due to usage of new SwiftUI APIs such as `Group(subviews:)`)

## Installation

Clone the repository and open the project in Xcode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SwipeablePageViewDemo.git
cd SwipeablePageViewDemo
open SwipeablePageViewDemo.xcodeproj
```

## Previews

The project includes SwiftUI previews for `ContentView` configured with both horizontal and vertical swipe directions. To view these previews:

1. Open `ContentView.swift` in Xcode.
2. Ensure the preview canvas is visible.
3. Switch between the horizontal and vertical previews to test the different swipe configurations.
